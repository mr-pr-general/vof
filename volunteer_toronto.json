Our idea is a simple one that works. We provide one nutritious daily meal in a place of learning in order to attract chronically poor children into the classroom, where they receive an education that can, in the future, be their ladder out of poverty. Every child deserves an education and enough to eat.\n\nOur work is mainly carried out by our wonderful army of Community Ambassadors who volunteer by contributing in all sorts of different ways.
